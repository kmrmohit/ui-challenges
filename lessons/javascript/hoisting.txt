Hoisting means putting a var/function/class at 
the top of the function scope, so that it can be accessed without 
throwing any errors.

var is initialised with undefined while
let and const are not initialised.

so referencing let and const variables before initialization will return a reference error.
This is called temporal dead zone. This is the code block b/w variable
declaration and initialization.
