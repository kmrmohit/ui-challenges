A programming language is said to have first class functions when
functinos in that language are treated like any other varible.

here funtions can be passed as arguments to other functions, can be 
returned by other functions and can be assigned as a value to a variable.

Eg.

Assign function to variable
const foo = function(){}

Pass a function as arguments
function a(){}
function b(func1){
    func1()
}
b(a)


Return a function
function a() {
    return function(){
        return 1
    }
}
