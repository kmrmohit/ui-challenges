Image tag

Links use the <img> tag

img element should be provided atleast two attributes
src - location of Image
alt - text for screen reader if applicable

img element is self closing. With HTML5, we don't need to do like <img/>, we can just do <img> (both are correct)

png image formats generally used :
1. when transparency is involved
2. better image quality
