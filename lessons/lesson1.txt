em vs rem

Root element in most cases has a default font-size of 16px which is equal to 1em.
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}
     ==
html {

}

em - w.r.t font-size this unit is always multiplied by the root element value
h1 {
    font-size: 2em; //will be equal to 2*16px = 32px
}

but w.r.t padding or margin, this values has a compounding effect, it mutliplies the em values of all its descendants
p {
    font-size: 2em; //equal to 2*16px
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em; //if h1 is inside p, this will be 2*2*16px;
}


rem - doesnt compound. always multiplied by the root element value
p {
    font-size: 2em; //equal to 2*16px
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2rem; //if h1 is inside p, still this will be 2*16px;
}


ems and rems are very useful
1. just one change in the root element will revamp our website. highly useful for display on multiple screen sizes.
2. scalable solution
