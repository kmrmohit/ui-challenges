Q.What is the difference between SCSS and SASS ?

Ans: SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a pre-processor scripting language that will be compiled or interpreted into CSS. SassScript is itself a scripting language 
whereas SCSS is the main syntax for the SASS which builds on top of the existing CSS syntax. It makes use of semicolons and brackets like CSS (Cascaded Style Sheets).
SASS and SCSS can import each other. Sass actually makes CSS more powerful with math and variable support. 
Letâ€™s list down the main difference between SASS and SCSS. 
 

SASS is used when we need an original syntax, code syntax is not required for SCSS.
SASS follows strict indentation, SCSS has no strict indentation.
SASS has a loose syntax with white space and no semicolons, the SCSS resembles more to CSS style and use of semicolons and braces are mandatory.
SASS file extension is .sass and SCSS file extension is .scss.
SASS has more developer community and support than SCSS.
