vh,vw,vmax,vmin

vh = viewport height
vw = viewport width

vmax = maximum of vh and vw
vmin = minimum of vh and vw

e.g.
p {
    font-size: 2vmin; //would adjust the font-size for varying screen sizes without additional media queries
}

super useful units
1. can help in automatically adjusting layouts, according to device sizes
2. extensive testing would be required to ensure everything is working fine
